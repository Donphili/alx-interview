# Minimum Operations

This project calculates the fewest operations to transform 'H' to 'n' 'H' characters using Copy All and Paste operations.

## Usage

```python
from minoperations import minOperations

n = 4
result = minOperations(n)
print(f"Min operations to reach {n} char: {result}")

### Example

$ python3 0-main.py
Min operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min operations to reach 12 characters: 7
